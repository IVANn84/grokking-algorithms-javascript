# _Grokking Algorithms in Javascript_

#### _A repo with all the algorithms in Aditya Bhargava's 'Grokking Alogrithms' that I've write in Javascript and any other practice I've done with them, 3/3/2018._

#### By _**William Kulha**_

## Description

_I learned a lot about front end web design using [learn how to program](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com) (Epicodus' curriculum available to everyone for free ðŸ˜Š), but I wanted to learn more about data structures and algorithms. A little googling told me Aditya Bhargava's book was the place to start. This is the repo where I'll push all of the book's algorithms that I write in Javscript as I work through them._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _If you only need a little snippet of code from this repo, just look through the raws and copy and paste what you need._
* _But if you want the whole thing..._
* _Open the console on your machine and enter these commands (without adding an extra dollar sign):_
* <code>$cd desktop</code>
* <code>$git clone https://github.com/WilliamKulha/grokking-algorithms-javascript.git</code>
* _Open up the new shiny folder on your desktop and enjoy looking through all the files in this repo._

## Known Bugs

_This is a collection of algorithms and, as written, there are no bugs. There might be some problems if they're implemented, but that might be a bug for the implementation rather than this source code._

## Planned Updates

_Some sort of SPA that lets users interact with the different algorithms and see either how they work, why they're better than alternatives, and or what cases they're best used in._


## Support and contact details

_That doesn't mean I'm not interested in helping you solve problems that might come up using this bits of code! If you have any problems, drop me a line at kulha.william@gmail.com, and we'll see what we can do to get everything straightened out!_

## Technologies Used

_Vanilla Javascript_
